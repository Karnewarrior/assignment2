    2.How many commits have been done to the repository (not only by you, but by anyone) so far? Write the git command you used to get this information (4 points)
	Seven commits thus far, only one by myself. I did not use a console command, I'm using the Github Desktop which has a tab for History.
	
    3.When was the README.md  file modified last? Write the git command you used to get this information (4 points)
	Readme.md was last modified at 10:09 PM on 10/17/2021. This information was found in the history tab of Github Desktop
	
    4.Mention two reasons why branches are used in a Git repository (4 points)
	Branches are used to lighten data loads by only moving required files. A branch is simply a pointer to a source repository. This is why merging a branch is not possible when the source repository has had a more recent commit.
	
    5.What is the difference between git log and git status? (4 points)
	git log only shows the committed history, while git status includes modifications still uncommitted.
	
    6.What command would you use to see the commits where “Vehicle.h” was one of the committed files? (4 points)
	git --follow <filename>
	
    7.What command would you use to see the commits whose commit message contains the word “file”? (4 points)
	git log grep="file"
	
    8.In the context of object-oriented programming (I) What is inheritance? (II) What is polymorphism? (III) What is encapsulation? (6 points)
	inheritance is a class which is derived from and shares components with another class. Polymorphism is allowing a specific routine/function to use a different type of variable when required. Encapsulation is bundling data together, such as creating, moving, and accessing multiple variables/functions at once in the form of a class.
